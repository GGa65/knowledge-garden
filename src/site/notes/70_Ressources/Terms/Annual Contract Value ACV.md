## ACV Definition

ACV (annual contract value) shows the **worth of a contract as a KPI that is normalized to a year**. It´s a yearly value of of an individual customer and very helpful in subscription based business as a sales KPI.

> Basically, it’s the average annual dollar amount a contract is worth, excluding any one-time fees or purchases.[^1]

> Annual contract value (ACV) calculates the revenue generated from a single contract normalized over a year.[^2]

Since it´s clearly a calculated thing, we must understand it as KPI that makes **success of sales** comparable among all the sales guys a company have. It´s counted only once --> Depending on the company's rules in the year or quarter or month of deal closing. 

The calculation is very simple:

ACV = (total contract value) / (number of years)

- for total contract value look at [[10_Zettel/TCV\|TCV]].
- number of years means: the number of years the subscription is valid
