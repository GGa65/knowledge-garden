> **21st century skills** comprise ***skills, abilities, and learning dispositions*** that have been identified as being ***required for success in 21st century society and workplaces*** by educators, business leaders, academics, and governmental agencies.  This is part of a growing international movement focusing on the skills required for students to master in preparation for success in a rapidly changing, [[digital society\|digital society]].  
> Many of these skills are also ***associated with deeper learning***, which is based on mastering skills such as analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork.  These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based.
> During the latter decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, ***society has undergone an accelerating pace of change in economy and technology***.  Its effects on the workplace, and thus on the demands on the educational system preparing students for the workforce, have been significant in several ways.  Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing workplace and society.

> The current workforce is significantly more likely to change career fields or jobs. 
> - Those in the Baby Boom generation entered the workforce with a goal of stability; 
> - subsequent generations are more concerned with finding happiness and fulfillment in their work lives.  
> - Young workers in North America are now likely to change jobs at a much higher rate than previously, as much as once every 4.4 years on average.  
> - With this employment mobility comes a demand for different skills, ones that enable people to be flexible and adaptable in different roles or in different career fields.

> As western economies have transformed from industrial-based to service-based, trades and vocations have smaller roles.  However, specific hard skills and mastery of particular skill sets, with a focus on digital literacy, are in increasingly high demand. 
> People skills that involve interaction, collaboration, and managing others are increasingly important.  
> Skills that enable people to be flexible and adaptable in different roles or in different fields, those that involve processing information and managing people more than manipulating equipmentâ€”in an office or a factoryâ€”are in greater demand.    
> These are also referred to as "applied skills" or "soft skills", including personal, interpersonal, or learning-based skills, such as life skills (problem-solving behaviors), people skills, and social skills.  
> The skills have been grouped into three main areas:
